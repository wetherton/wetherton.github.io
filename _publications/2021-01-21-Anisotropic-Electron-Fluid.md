title: 'Anisotropic Electron Fluid Closure Validated by in Situ Spacecraft Observations in the far Exhaust of Guide-field Reconnection'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-21-Anisotropic-Electron-Fluid
excerpt: 'Anisotropic electron heating predictions of the equations of state of Le et al. (2009); https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.085001 (“the EoS”) are applied to reconnection in the Earth's magnetosheath. The model is applicable to open systems where electrons are streaming along magnetic field lines into the reconnection region, sourced by fixed external reservoirs of plasma ambient to the reconnection region. While spacecraft observations have previously shown the EoS to hold in the region near the X‐line, we find that for an event observed far downstream (∼100 di) from the X‐line both inflows and the exhaust follow the predictions of the EoS. Furthermore, the model underlying the EoS is extended to include additional perpendicular heating terms relevant to the considered event undergoing active magnetic compression with local electron trapping. The agreement between the spacecraft observations and the EoS emphasizes the roles of the ambient plasma sources and the dynamics of trapped and passing electrons in setting and controlling the anisotropic electron heating at large scale in naturally occurring plasma configurations.'
