Magnetic reconnection is the process by which magnetic energy is converted to particle energy through a topological rearrangement of magnetic field lines, and it is thought to be involved in a host of plasma phenomena including solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the generation of terrestrial aurorae. Though a ubiquitous process, the underlying dynamics of magnetic reconnection are not yet well understood. Several fluid models exist to explain reconnection, but are generally insufficient in explaining a process that is innately intertwined with small-scale kinetic physics (which is based on statistical distribution functions).

Computational simulation is vital to understanding magnetic reconnection, as it complements experimental observation with superior data resolution and access to a larger region of parameter space. For magnetic reconnection, the kinetic models required to capture full electron and ion dynamics necessitate the use of high performance computing, as billions of particles regularly cross over domains and constant communication is needed between cores. My research goal is to use VPIC fully-kinetic simulations to model collisionless magnetic reconnection and elucidate its underlying dynamics.
