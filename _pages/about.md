I am a PhD candidate in Plasma Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>. My research is in plasma theory and computation with a focus on magnetic reconnection. A profile of my work in the fellowship can be seen <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/fellow-reflections/blake-wetherton">here</a>.

I've taken more courses than anyone ought. The graduate-level ones are listed <a href="/courses/">here</a>.
