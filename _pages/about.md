I am a postdoctoral research associate at Los Alamos National Laboratory, working in the Plasma Theory and Applications (XCP-6) and Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics (T-5) groups. 

I did my PhD work in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>. My thesis research was in plasma theory and computation with a focus on magnetic reconnection. A profile of my work in the fellowship can be seen <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/fellow-reflections/blake-wetherton">here</a>.

I've taken more courses than anyone ought. The graduate-level ones are listed <a href="/courses/">here</a>.
