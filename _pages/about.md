I am a PhD candidate in Plasma Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow. My research is in plasma theory and computation with a focus on magnetic reconnection.

I've taken more courses than anyone ought. The graduate-level ones are listed <a href="/courses/">here</a>.
