I enjoy taking classes. Here's a comprehensive list of the non-research courses I've taken at the graduate level. Three-digit courses were taken at the University of Wisconsin as part of my PhD program, while the five-digit courses were classes I took as an undergraduate at Purdue.

Plasma
======
* PHYS 525: Introduction to Plasmas
* PHYS 724: Plasma Waves and Instabilities
* PHYS 725: Plasma Kinetic Theory and Radiation Processes
* PHYS 726: Plasma Magnetohydrodynamics
* NE   903: Computational Ideal MHD

Astrophysics
======
* ASTRON 702: Basic Astrophysics II
* ASTRON 715: Stellar Interiors and Evolution
* PHYS   772: High Energy Astrophysics

Other Physics
======
* PHYS 711: Theoretical Physics: Dynamics
* PHYS 715: Statistical Mechanics
* PHYS 717: Relativity
* PHYS 721: Theoretical Physics: Electrodynamics
* PHYS 731: Quantum Mechanics I
* PHYS 732: Quantum Mechanics II
* PHYS 805: Techniques of Theoretical Physics
* PHYS 831: Quantum Field Theory I
* PHYS 55600: Introductory Nuclear Physics

Mathematics
======
* MATH 714: Methods of Computational Math I
* MATH 715: Methods of Computational Math II
* MATH 716: Ordinary Differential Equations
* MATH 722: Complex Analysis
* MATH 751: Introductory Topology I
* MATH 819: Partial Differential Equations I
* MATH 820: Partial Differential Equations II
* MATH 821: Advanced Topics in Real Analysis (More PDEs)
* MATH 51000: Vector Calculus
* MATH 51100: Linear Algebra

At Purdue, I made the mistake of assuming a course being graduate level implied some novelty. Those two math courses were a complete waste of time. 

Computer Science
======
* CS  759: High Performance Computing for Applications in Engineering
* CS  787: Advanced Algorithms
* ECE 757: Advanced Computer Architecture II

Mechanical Engineering
======
* ME 56200: Advanced Dynamics
* ME 56300: Mechanical Vibrations
* ME 57900: Digital Signal Processing
* ME 61200: Continuum Mechanics

Economics
======
* ECON 51100: Intermediate Microeconomics
* ECON 51200: Intermediate Macroeconomics
